# Building a Quadrifilar Helix Antenna for Satellite Telemetry

## Scope

This project is a documentation of my attempt to build a QFH (quadrifilar helix) antenna from scratch. This antenna is ideal for capturing satellite telemetry as it is omnidirectional, unlike the standard v-dipole that comes with SDR kits.

## Resources

* The supply list for this project can be found in the _Acknowledgements_ section, where I've linked to USARadioGuy's tutorial. I did not deviate from the recommended supplies.
